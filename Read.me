> Eliminating hospital gate queues and pharmacy payment bottlenecks across Africa



## 🚨 The Problem

Every day across Africa, patients lose hours of their lives:

- **6 AM arrival** → Stand in queue for 2-3 hours just to get an entry ticket/pass
- **Finally see the doctor** → Stand in another long pharmacy queue to pay for medications
- **Healthcare access** becomes a full-day affair when it should take minutes

## 💡 Our Solution

A distributed healthcare queue management system that:

1. **Virtual Entry Tickets**: Get your hospital pass on your phone before leaving home
2. **Digital Pharmacy Payments**: Pay for medications via mobile money, just go to collect
3. **Real-time Queue Visibility**: Know exactly when to arrive based on current wait times

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- **60-80% reduction** in waiting time
- **Works offline-first** for low-connectivity areas
- **Pan-African scalability** from Cameroon to the entire continent
- **Collaboration-ready** for inter-hospital referrals and resource sharing

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This is a **distributed system** with:

- **Transparency**: Real-time queue visibility, pricing, and service metrics
- **Scalability**: Independent hospital nodes, microservices architecture
- **Fault Tolerance**: Offline-first operation, data replication, graceful degradation
- **Collaboration**: Inter-hospital referrals, pharmacy networks, shared resources
